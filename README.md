# Overview

The File Finder is a command-line tool written in Erlang designed to recursively search a specified directory for files with a given extension. It uses Erlang's strengths in concurrency, fault-tolerance, and functional programming to build a reliable file search system.

This tool allows users to input a directory path and a file extension, and then it will recursively search through all subdirectories, printing paths to files that match the specified extension. The program supports interactive search, making it user-friendly and adaptable to different search criteria.

The purpose of writting this program was to allow me to first learn how to write in erlang, and secondly practice the concept of recursion. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
